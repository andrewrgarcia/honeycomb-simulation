# Honeycomb Simulation

This is a Next.js app that simulates the movement of honeybees within a honeycomb structure. The project includes components, pages, and styles for visualizing the simulation, as well as the `Nextjs_Honeycomb_Simulation.txt` file for reconstructing the project files with `MakeFilesHere.sh`.

For reconstruction instructions, refer to the [`files-here-wzrd` repository](https://github.com/andrewrgarcia/files-here-wzrd).
